# SetHungerHealth

A plugin that lets you set the hunger and health of a player when he respawns with a configuration file. After installing the plugin and reloading the server a configuration file **SetHungerHealth/settings.yml** will be generated in the plugin folder. The configuration file contains two variables **Hunger** and **Health**. Both can be edited by entering a double between 1.0 and 20.0 for health and 0.0 and 20.0 for hunger. **NOTE: after editing the file, remember to save and reload the server**.
